left and right censoring date, a labeled event column that contains the

accepted parameter options are listed, with the type of table that will be
generated:
traditional: Traditional survival table that has single censoring
event (trad)
counting : Formally called the Andersen and Gill model (ag).
Counting process model assumes each event is independent and that a subject
contributes to the risk set during the time under observation. Multiple
events are treated as a new (but delayed) entry that is followed until the
next event. This means subjects under observation are at risk for a second
event, even without having had a prior event. There are thus no strata in
the model.
marginal: Formally called the Wei-Lin-Weissfield model, but more
commonly known as a marginal model (marginal). Marginal models assumes
each event is a separate process. Each subject is at risk for all events.
The time for an event starts at the beginning of follow-up for each
subject. Thus, each risk period is considered a different strata
(regardless of if subject had an event or not).
conditional A: Formally called the Prentice, Williams, and Peterson
total time model (pwptt). Conditional A models order events by
stratification, based on the number of events prior. All subjects are at
risk for the left strata, but only those with a previous event are at
risk for a successive event. The total time to event is used.
conditional B: Formally called the Prentice, Williams, and Peterson
gap time model (pwpgt). Conditional B models also order events by strata
(like conditional A), however the time to outcome is defined as the gap
between the time of previous event.

<p>A data frame organized into a survival table format. Output options
are in <strong>Details</strong>. Generally, the following columns are generated:</p><ul><li><p><strong>id</strong>: An ID column is created</p></li>
<li><p><strong>start</strong>: A formatted start time, usually 0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop</strong>: A formatted stop time, in days, from prior event</p></li>

    <p>This function takes every event date, and creates several types of
recurrent event tables. It orders the data chronologically for repeat
events. Currently does normal (left event) and recurrent models (counting,
marginal, and conditional A and B models). Further details can be found at
<a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/faq/how-can-i-model-repeated-events-survival-analysis-in-proc-phreg/" class="external-link">IDRE</a>.</p><ul><li><p>For recurrent events, the final censoring event can include death, or can
be ignored if its not considered a failure event.</p></li>
<li><p>For traditional survival analysis, <code>censor</code> is required and <code>event_dates</code>
should be left as NULL. The function will do the rest.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Importantly, for large datasets of recurrent data (&gt;500
rows), this function will show significant slow-down since it uses an
intuitive approach on defining the datasets. Future iterations will create
a vectorized approach that should provide performance speed-ups.</p>
