The goal of `lazarus` is to provide tools to allow for data tidying and
analysis of recurrent events and other longitudinal outcomes. The name
comes from the story and/or mythology of *Lazarus*, a man that had died
and was brought back to life from the Gospels. More popularly, the
*Lazarus Pit* can heal injuries and grant immortality in the DC Comics
universe.
