The goal of `aion` is to handle cyclical events, of both continuous and
categorical data. The name stems from the Hellenic tradition of
perpetual and rhythmic cycles of time - instead of linear time.
Sometimes seen with the symbol of the *ouroboros*, of the snake eating
its tail, *Aion is the god of the cyclic ages*.
